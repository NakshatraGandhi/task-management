# task-management
The Task Management App is built using **React**, **React Router**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite** for fast development.
It allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **manage tasks** with a simple and responsive UI.
Navigation between pages is handled using **React Router DOM**.
The app uses **state hooks** to manage task data and ensures smooth user experience.
